# Kaggle Playground Series 2023 - Horse Health Prediction

## Submission Readme

### Overview
Welcome to my submission for the Kaggle Playground Series 2023 - Horse Health Prediction competition! This README provides an overview of the approach, models used, and key results.

### Approach
For this competition, the goal was to predict the health outcomes of horses based on various synthetic medical indicators. I adopted a comprehensive approach, leveraging three powerful machine learning models: XGBoost (xgb), CatBoost (cat), and LightGBM (lgb). The ensemble of these models aimed to achieve robust predictions and enhance overall performance.

### Models Used
1. **XGBoost (xgb):**
   - Version: xgb01
   - Weighted F1 Score: 0.81978 Â± 0.61627

2. **LightGBM (lgb):**
   - Version: lgb01
   - Weighted F1 Score: 0.76580 Â± 0.35271

3. **CatBoost (cat):**
   - Version: cat01
   - Weighted F1 Score: 0.68336 Â± 0.54797

4. **XGBoost (xgb):**
   - Version: xgb1
   - Weighted F1 Score: 0.68707 Â± 0.43532

### Ensemble Results
The ensemble of these models produced an overall F1 score of 0.75617 Â± 0.01913, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining diverse models for prediction.

### Future Improvements
While this submission represents a strong effort, continuous improvement is essential. Future iterations could explore additional feature engineering, model tuning, and ensemble strategies to further enhance predictive performance.

### Acknowledgments
